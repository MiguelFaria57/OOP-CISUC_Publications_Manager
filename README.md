## Information
The project has 14 “.java” files, corresponding to the classes used in the project, and 3 “.txt” files, containing information about the researchers (“Investigadores.txt”), about the research groups (“GruposDeInvestigacao.txt”) and about publications (“Publicacoes.txt”).

Regarding Javadoc, the “index.html” file present in the “javadoc” folder must be opened in order to consult the class summary.

To run the “Projeto.jar” file in the “exe” folder, it is necessary to place this file and the text files in the same folder, open a terminal, enter the directory of that folder and enter the command “java -jar Projeto.jar ”. Alternatively, you can run the “Projeto.bat” file.

Regarding the operation of the program, when executing it, if the object files already exist, the menu is displayed; otherwise, messages are displayed to control the writing of object files and only then the menu.

In the menu, there are different options that the user can choose from:
- if you choose option “1”, a second menu is displayed in which the user must choose the option they want again.
- if you choose option “2” and “3”, the user is asked to enter the name or acronym of the group they want.
- if you choose option “4”, the user is asked to enter the email address of the researcher they want.
- if you choose option “5”, the list is immediately displayed.

When the user wants to exit the program, just choose option “6” in the initial menu.
